    "<p align=\"justify\">\n",
    "    Convolutional Neural Networks are great for <b>classifiying images</b>. In fact, the very architecture of such networks are built with an intention to feed in images as inputs. To help you understand in a lay man's term, imagine there exists a *black-box* that takes an image (an image of a hotdog or not) and splits out whether the input image being fed was in fact, an image of a hotdog.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Wait, that's it?\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">\n",
    "    What makes this quite a complex problem is that there are a gazillion probabilities of various kinds of hotdogs - hotdogs with cheese, hotdogs without cheese, with tomato or mustard sauce, Chili dog, etc. Also, whether the hotdog is on a plate, or on one's hand, the combinations are endless! Let's not forget other possibilities of scale, orientation, etc. And we (or the *black-box*) needs to cater to almost all such possibilities.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does a computer sees an image?\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">\n",
    "    An image consists of 3 properties - width, height (also known as the resolution of the image) and a depth ( also known as the channel of the image). For most cases, an image file is encoded as an RGB (or Red-Blue-Green) Channels. Each channel within the image is a matrix of dimensions width x height consisting values within the range 0 to 255. Such layers of channels then combine to form a single colorized digital image.\n",

    "#### Let's take it simpler.\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">\n",
    "    Before moving to Hotdogs, let's consider a simple example where the goal is to classify our MNIST data set containing grayscale images (or a channel depth equal to 1). We'll have them preprocessed further to make this more understandable.\n",
